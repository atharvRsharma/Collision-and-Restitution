ImGUI is used for all GUI implementation

Has changeable gravity, radius, bounce damping and other variable which can be edited

Also has a loss of energy toggle, which is a bit janky dues to resolutions not being very accurate when the balls bounce into each other but still fun to look at.
Can also be paused

Objects can be placed and removed using left and right click respectively.
Bit of an older project, therefore no OOP concepts are followed thus everything's in the Main.cpp
